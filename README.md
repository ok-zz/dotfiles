# Oliver Kohl's Dot Files
Massively inspired by https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. 
It uses my [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/ok/oh-my-zsh) fork of [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal. It will prompt you before it does anything destructive.

```terminal
git clone git://github.com/ok/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

Scripts in /setup don't get executed at install but have to get run manually for now.  
Scripts in /scripts don't serve any setup purpose.
